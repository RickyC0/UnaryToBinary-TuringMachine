# Unary to Binary Turing Machine

This repository contains an implementation of a Turing machine that converts unary numbers to binary numbers. A unary number is represented by a sequence of `1`s, and a binary number is represented in the standard binary notation.

## Description

The Turing machine reads a unary number from the input tape, processes it, and writes the corresponding binary number to the tape. The unary number, will be converted from a sequence of `1`s, to its binary notation with `0` and `1`.
